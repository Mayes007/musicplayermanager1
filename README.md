# Music Player Manager

The Music Player Manager is a web-based application that allows users to manage and play music files using a local JSON-based database. Song information such as title, artist, and file location is stored in a structured JSON file, which acts as the database. The application dynamically reads this data using JavaScript and plays music directly in the browser through the HTML audio player.

This project demonstrates basic database concepts such as structured data storage, data retrieval, and client-side data management without using a backend server.
